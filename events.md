If datasets are created with public funds then it is hard to argue that they shouldnâ€™t be freely accessible to everyone (as long as safety and personal privacy is not compromised). Open cultural data refers to digital records of the collections held by cultural heritage institutions that are placed in the public domain under open license. This year, Coding da Vinci is on track to feature over 100 open datasets (metadata, pictures, sounds and videos) addressing different cultural topics - from insect box scans, to historical buildings, painting, music instruments and much more! You can find all [datasets](https://codingdavinci.de/daten/), along with open source code from the participants of previous events for all past Coding da Vinci [projects](https://codingdavinci.de/projekte/) on these pages to explore and re-mix.
